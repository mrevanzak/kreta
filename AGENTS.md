# AGENTS.md: AI Collaboration Guide

This document provides essential context for AI models interacting with this project. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency and maintain code quality.

AI collaborators should operate as expert Swift and SwiftUI developers, using this guide as the single source of truth for project standards.

## 1. Project Overview & Purpose

- **Primary Goal:** Native SwiftUI client for an e-commerce marketplace that integrates Convex-backed data, Stripe-based checkout flows, and ActivityKit live updates, paired with a lightweight Bun/Convex server stub.
- **Business Domain:** Mobile commerce and order fulfillment tooling with real-time travel status experiments (train live activity prototype).

## 2. Core Technologies & Stack

- **Languages:** Swift 5.9+ (Observation framework usage), SwiftUI; TypeScript targeting Bun runtime. No Nim components are present despite legacy references.
- **Frameworks & Runtimes:** SwiftUI, Observation, ActivityKit, WidgetKit, ConvexMobile SDK, Stripe & StripePaymentSheet, JWTDecode. Server uses Bun v1.2+ runtime with Convex cloud database/client SDK.
- **Databases:** Convex cloud database via Convex SDK; no direct SQL/NoSQL drivers in-tree.
- **Key Libraries/Dependencies:** `HTTPClient` abstraction atop `URLSession`; `ConvexMobile.ConvexClient`; `TrainLiveActivityService` & `TrainActivityAttributes` for live activities; StripePaymentSheet flows; JWTDecode for token validation; server depends on `convex` NPM package.
- **Platforms:** iOS 16.1+ (ActivityKit) and iOS 17+ (Observation) simulators/devices; WidgetKit Live Activities; Bun-compatible server environments (macOS/Linux) for Convex dev server.
- **Package Manager:** Swift Package Manager via Xcode project configuration; Bun/npm for the server package management.

## 3. Architectural Patterns

- **Overall Architecture:** Multi-target SwiftUI application organized around MVVM-inspired "stores" and networking controllers, supplemented by ActivityKit widgets; companion Bun/Convex server providing placeholder backend APIs.
- **Directory Structure Philosophy:**
  - `/Client/Sources`: Primary Swift code separated into `Controllers/`, `Stores/`, `Services/`, `Networking/`, `Screens/`, `Views/`, `Validators/`, `Models/`, `Extensions/`, `Navigation/`, `Utility/`, `Custom Errors/`, and `Preview Content/` folders mirroring logical concerns.
  - `/Client/Shared`: Cross-target models shared with the Widget extension (e.g., `TrainActivityAttributes`).
  - `/Client/Widget`: WidgetKit target for Live Activities and Dynamic Island UI.
  - `/Client/Shared`, `/Client/Widget`: Compiled as additional targets referenced by Xcode project `kreta.xcodeproj`.
  - `/Server`: Bun/TypeScript Convex backend with `index.ts`, `convex/_generated` artifacts, and sample data.
  - `buildServer.json`: Xcode build server metadata (BSP) for Swift development tooling.
- **Module Organization:** Swift code is grouped by feature roleâ€”network controllers wrap REST endpoints, stores act as `@Observable` state containers, screens/views compose UI, and services encapsulate integrations. Shared structs live in `Models/` or `Shared/`, and navigation uses dedicated router abstractions.

## 4. Coding Conventions & Style Guide

- **Architecture & Structure:** Adopt Swift's latest language and framework capabilities, preserve the MVVM-inspired layering used across the app, prefer value semantics (`struct`) when practical, and ensure UI decisions track Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
- **Formatting:** Follow Swift's standard four-space indentation and trailing space trimming. ActivityKit/Widget files occasionally use two-space indents, but prefer four spaces for new code. Keep braces on the same line per Swift conventions and run Xcode's auto-formatting.
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Types and enums: PascalCase (`TrainLiveActivityService`, `ProductStore`).
  - Properties/functions/variables: camelCase (`loadAllProducts`, `trainLiveActivityService`).
  - Protocol/extension filenames: `Type+Category.swift` (`EnvironmentValues+Extensions.swift`).
  - Swift source files live in PascalCase grouped by feature; keep preview-only helpers in `Preview Content`.
  - Use imperative verb phrases for methods (`fetchProducts`, `loadCart`).
  - Prefix boolean flags with `is`/`has`/`should` and keep names descriptive per Apple style guides.
- **Swift Language Practices:** Leverage the strong type system and intentional optional handling, prefer `let` over `var` unless mutation is required, use `async`/`await` for concurrency, and model recoverable failures with `Result` where it improves clarity.
- **State Management:** Favor Observation's `@Observable` models alongside SwiftUI property wrappers (`@State`, `@StateObject`, `@Bindable`) or `@Published` for legacy compatibility, and use protocol extensions for shared behavior.
- **API Design:**
  - **Style:** Primarily procedural with lightweight structs/enums and `@Observable` classes for state. Services expose async functions returning domain models.
  - **Abstraction:** Networking is funneled through `Resource` + `HTTPClient`; controllers convert high-level intents (login, payment) into HTTP calls; stores expose derived data/computed properties for UI binding.
  - **Extensibility:** Add new endpoints by composing `Resource` instances and extending existing stores/controllers; shared models conform to `Codable` and `Identifiable` for SwiftUI compatibility; ActivityKit attributes designed for future station states.
  - **Trade-offs:** Emphasis on developer ergonomics with async/await and SwiftUI Observation; relies on Convex and Stripe SDKs rather than manual performance tuning. Networking errors are centralized for better localization.
- **UI Development:** Default to SwiftUI views, reach for UIKit only when platform APIs demand it, use SF Symbols for glyphs, support dark mode and Dynamic Type, respect the safe area, and test layouts across device classes and orientations. Handle keyboard transitions gracefully.
- **Performance:** Profile critical paths with Instruments, lazy load expensive subviews or assets, coalesce network activity, manage background tasks responsibly, and guard against redundant state updates to avoid memory churn.
- **Data & Reactive Flow:** Use Core Data for richer on-device models when needed, keep lightweight preferences in `UserDefaults`, integrate Combine or Observation publishers for reactive flows, and design dependency injection that keeps data flow explicit and testable.
- **Common Patterns & Idioms:**
  - **Metaprogramming:** Minimal; relies on Swift macros like `@Observable` (compiler-provided) rather than custom templates.
  - **Memory Management:** Standard ARC with value semantics (`struct`) for models and reference types (`class`) for stores/services; ActivityKit contexts marked `Sendable`.
  - **Polymorphism:** Compile-time generics via `Resource<T>`; runtime polymorphism is rare, with simple enums and structs preferred.
  - **Type Safety:** Frequent use of `Codable`, `Identifiable`, `Hashable`, and optional handling; `@MainActor` to confine UI-affecting operations.
  - **Concurrency:** Async/await for HTTP and ActivityKit interactions; Live Activity updates iterate through `Activity` collection.
  - **Error Handling:** Throwing functions propagate `NetworkError` or feature-specific error enums; controller/store methods `throw` to surface failures; UI uses `Task` with `do/catch` logging.

## 5. Key Files & Entrypoints

- **Main Entrypoint:** `Client/Sources/App.swift` declares `HelloMarketClientApp` as the `@main` SwiftUI app, injecting a `ConvexClient` and root `MainTabNavigator`.
- **Configuration:**
  - `Client/Sources/Utility/Constants.swift` centralizes REST endpoints and Convex deployment URL (controlled via `CONVEX_URL`).
  - `buildServer.json` configures the Xcode build server (BSP) for Swift toolchains.
  - No Nim configuration files exist; set environment keys via Xcode schemes.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** No CI configurations are present; establish workflows in `.github/workflows/` if needed.

## 6. Development & Testing Workflow

- **Local Development Environment:**

  1. Open `Client/kreta.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15 or newer (iOS 17 SDK recommended for `Observation`).
  2. Provide required environment variables (e.g., `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CONVEX_URL`, API base URLs) via the run scheme or shell before launching.
  3. Ensure backend endpoints at `http://localhost:8080` are available (either by running the Bun/Convex server or a separate API service).
  4. For command-line builds use `xcodebuild -project Client/kreta.xcodeproj -scheme kreta -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build` and swap `build` with `test` when tests exist.
  5. For the server, run `bun install` then `bun run index.ts` or `npm run dev` with `npx convex dev` to start Convex.

- **Quality Expectations:** Cover common user flows with XCTest, drive UI regressions with XCUITest as they are added, exercise performance scenarios, simulate error states, and keep accessibility audits in the workflow.
- **Task Configuration:** Swift uses standard Xcode schemes; no `.nims` or Nimble tasks. Server relies on Bun scripts defined in `package.json`.
- **Testing:** XCTest targets are not yet checked in. Mirror source tree under a `Tests/` group when adding tests (e.g., `Stores/ProductStoreTests.swift`), and execute via Xcode or `xcodebuild test`.
- **CI/CD Process:** Not configured. Future pipelines should run Swift formatters/builds and Bun/Convex linting, then deploy Live Activity entitlements as required.

## 7. Specific Instructions for AI Collaboration

- **Contribution Guidelines:** Maintain the existing folder boundaries (`Controllers`, `Stores`, `Services`, etc.). Extend current types before introducing parallel utilities. Provide screenshots or recordings for visible UI changes, and ensure new networking flows include appropriate error handling and token management.
- **Security:** Do not commit secrets (Stripe keys, Convex deployment tokens). Keep API endpoints centralized in `Constants`. Validate JWT tokens via `TokenValidator`, encrypt sensitive payloads, enable certificate pinning where feasible, lean on the system Keychain and biometrics for strong authentication, honor App Transport Security requirements, and treat input validation as a first-class concern.
- **Dependencies:** Add Swift dependencies through Xcode project settings (SPM) and mirror them in both app and widget targets as necessary. For server dependencies, update `package.json` and re-run `bun install`; commit resulting lockfiles (`bun.lock`, `yarn.lock`) consistently.
- **Commit Messages:** Use imperative, scoped subjects (e.g., `Add cart quantity badge`, `Refine HTTPClient retries`). Separate unrelated refactors from feature commits to preserve review clarity.
- **Feature Expectations:** Plan for deep linking, push notifications, background processing, localization, resilient error handling, and analytics/logging hooks as part of major feature introductions.
- **Process & Tooling:** Rely on SwiftUI previews for rapid feedback, follow the team's Git branching and code review practices, keep inline documentation up to date, and pursue continuous integration coverage once pipelines are introduced.
- **App Store Readiness:** Ensure privacy strings and capability entitlements are declared, audit in-app purchase flows, comply with App Store Review Guidelines, support app thinning where practical, and maintain correct signing assets.

### Store Error Handling Pattern

To keep stores UI-agnostic and consistent across the app, follow this pattern:

- Stores should expose async throwing methods and avoid keeping UI-facing error state.
- Do NOT add `errorMessage` to stores. Keep ephemeral flags like `isLoading` when useful for UI; reset them using `defer`.
- Call sites (screens/views) should `do/try/await` and handle failures with the `showMessage` environment action.

Example usage at the call site:

```swift
do {
    try await store.loadInitial()
} catch {
    showMessage(error.localizedDescription)
}
```

Benefits:

- Errors are surfaced where user feedback is decided, keeping stores free of presentation concerns.
- Consistent user messaging via `Environment(\.showMessage)`.
- Easier testing of stores (deterministic, no UI coupling).
